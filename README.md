# final_cloud_22f_backend

Backend for Final Project in Cloud Computing.

## MySQL Files

- The MySQL files used to populate the Database in `seed.js` file are too large so they are not included on Github.
- Populating the Database will take VERY LONG because of the 100MB file. Therefore, only run `seed.js` if there is no other option.
- After placing the correct files into the `mysql` folder, run the following commands starting from root directory of project.

```bash
cd mysql
node seed.js
```

## Getting Started

```bash
npm start
```
